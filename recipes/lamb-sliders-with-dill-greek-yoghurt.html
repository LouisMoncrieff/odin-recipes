        <!--ordered list for method-->
        <h2>Method</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Add lamb, rosemary, oregano, garlic, onion, salt, egg 
                yolk, breadcrumbs, and 1 teaspoon olive oil to a large 
                bowl. Mix until combined. Do not over mix.</li>
            <li>Separate the mixture into 15 loose balls. Flatten into 
                patties about the size of the pita or slider buns.</li>
            <li>Heat a large griddle or cast-iron skillet to a medium-high 
                heat, drizzle 1/2 tablespoon of olive oil. Add half of the 
                patties to the griddle or skillet, use a spatula to flatten 
                the patties as much as your can. Cook until golden brown and 
                crispy, about 2-3 minutes. Flip and cook another 1-2 minutes.</li>
            <li>Repeat with 1/2 tablespoon olive oil and the remaining patties.</li>
            <li>While the patties cook, add the Greek yogurt, dill, lemon juice 
                and teaspoon olive oil to a small bowl. Season with salt and 
                pepper. Stir until combined. Season to taste with salt and pepper.</li>
            <li>To assemble: Cut a slit in each pita wide enough to fit patties 
                in. Stuff cooked patties in the pita, spoon a little bit of dill 
                sauce in and layer cucumbers on top. Garnish with more dried or 
                fresh dill.</li>
        </ol>
